STAGE 2

PHYSICS
//-Add world meshes to server
//-Add food items to server side
//-Add player model to server side
//-Add LERP for the other player models
//-Fix rotation being sent over
-Change server structure so that when restock icon is pressed,
server spawns the items and sends their position over to the players
-implement sending over the physics positions every 20 frames
//    -Debug the rollback window
//    -Implemented client sending information evert 20ms
//    -Need to implement server fixed loop and buffer system

Layer Architecture for items
    -Items are made out of stack layers
    -When you grab on any of the items in the stack, you take the top

Server needs to keep track of scene positions so it
can send the correct positions and items to a new player

//Server architecture for respawning items
//Broadcast the spawn
//Server architecture for maintaing/spooling the items that can be spawned
//Test item grabs

STAGE 1 (didn't do animations)
//Create websocket architecture between client and server
//Import restaurant models to create the world
//Import Cylinder model to create the player
//Add animation and button press functionality to the player
//Send over player data to the server for broadcasting
//Create object models and functionalities
