Layer Architecture for items
    -Items are made out of stack layers
    -When you grab on any of the items in the stack, you take the top

Server needs to keep track of scene positions so it
can send the correct positions and items to a new player

//Server architecture for respawning items
//Broadcast the spawn
//Server architecture for maintaing/spooling the items that can be spawned
//Test item grabs
